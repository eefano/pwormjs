# Pizza Worm Js

A very brutal port from an old DOS game of mine, a poor attempt of cloning another DOS game called "Pizza Worm".

[Play it here](https://eefano.github.io/pwormjs/)

It's like Snake, but with steering worms.
It has local multiplayer, up to 3 players on the same keyboard.

Press 1,2 or 3 to restart with 1,2 or 3 worms.
[Z][X] keys turn the Worm #1
[J][K] keys turn the Worm #2
Left-Right arrow keys turn the Worm #3

The window title displays the score and endgame reason.

The codebase maintains ancient drawing algorithms and a silly sin() lookup table.
